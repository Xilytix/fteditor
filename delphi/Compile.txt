FTEditor compilation notes

- Compiles with Delphi XE (any edition I believe)
- May compile with Delphi 2010 however generics bugs may need to be worked around
- Prerequesite components are:
  * PJVersionInfo
    Downloadable from http://www.delphidabbler.com/software/verinfo/inst
    Does NOT need to be installed in IDE (files only need to be present on computer).
    Add PJVersionInfoLib Delphi environmental variable (Tools | Options | Environmental Variables | User overrides)
     which points to folder where PJVersionInfo files (source or DCU) are.
  * TFieldedText
    Downloadable with SVN from https://tfieldedtext.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/tfieldedtext
    Does NOT need to be installed in IDE (files only need to be present on computer).
    Add FieldedTextSrc Delphi environmental variable  which points to folder where TFieldedText source files are.
