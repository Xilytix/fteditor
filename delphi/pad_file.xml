			<Char_Desc_250>FTEditor is an editor for Fielded Text files (such as CSV files).  It lets you edit a Fielded Text file with a simultaneous text and grid view.  It also lets you visually and interactively create and edit the Meta for a Fielded Text file.</Char_Desc_250>
			<Char_Desc_450>FTEditor is an excellent tool for viewing and modifying Fielded Text files (such as CSV files). It can simultaneously display a file in a text edit window and a grid window. Color co-ordinated columns and highlighting of fields under the mouse and cursor easily allow data in both views to be compared.  FTEditor is based on Fielded Text (http://www.fieldedtext.org).  It can also be used to visually and interactively create Fielded Text Meta files.</Char_Desc_450>
			<Char_Desc_2000>FTEditor is an editor for Fielded Text files.  Fielded Text files are text files which contain tables of values.  CSV files are a common type of fielded text files however there are other types of fielded text files - for example, files containing fixed width fields.

With FTEditor you can view and edit a fielded text file with a simultaneous edit and grid view.  The text file is displayed in both a text edit window and a grid.  As the file is modified in the the edit window, the grid can be automatially updated.

Both the edit window and the grid window can display colored field columns.  This makes it easy to identify matching columns in both views.  Both views can also highlight the field which is currently under the mouse or selected by the cursor; enabling corresponding fields to be easily identified.

In each view, there is a status display showing the value and properties of the current selected field.  There is also a status display which shows the value and properties of the field currently under the mouse.

The structure and format of a fielded text file and its fields can be set with several display panels in FTEditor.  These panels allow you to set or modify all of the properties as specified by the proposed Fielded Text standard.  This standard aims to be compatible with nearly all existing text files containing tables of values.  The capabilities of the standard can be viewed at http://www.fieldedtext.org

An error panel will display any parsing errors which arise when the text file does not match the properties set in the panels.  FTEditor can automatically parse the text file whenever the properties are change - allowing you to quickly set the correct ones.

The Meta properties can be saved to a Fielded Text Meta file.  This file can be loaded again to quickly set the properties if you want to view/edit a similar fielded text file in the future.  This Meta file can also be used by other software which supports the Fielded Text standard.
